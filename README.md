# ImplementingSearchesInRJM
This repository contains my code implementations for the following searches: Breadth First Search, A* Search, Hill Descent, Hill Descent with Random Restarts, Hill Descent with Random Uphill Steps, and Simulated Annealing. I also developed code that generates solvable Rook Jumping Mazes to use when performing the searches.
